                The subtitle generation feature has been successfully incorporated.
                Subtitles are created utilizing OpenAI's Whisper.
                It's important to acknowledge that automatically generated subtitles may not achieve 100% accuracy.
                Therefore, it is the responsibility of the presentation owner to review and rectify any inaccuracies in the transcribed text when requesting subtitles.
                The subtitles will be transcribed in the original audio language of the presentation, and translation options are not currently available.

            <p class="px-md-5 px-sm-1">
                To request subtitles for an existing presentation, hoover over the presentation’s thumbnail. Buttons will appear in the upper right corner of the thumbnail. Click on the edit-button to edit the presentation. At the bottom of the edit-page there is a toggle-button, switch the toggle-button to ‘on’ and click on the ‘Save’ button.
                If you would rather upload your own subtitle file, instead of generating a transcribed file, you can leave the toggle switch off and upload the subtitle file in the box. Don’t forget to click on the ‘Save’ button.
                Once you have requested subtitle generation the transcribing process starts. This takes some time depending on the current queue load. Once it is done you will receive an email.

                In section 8 there is a toggle-button, switch the toggle-button to ‘on’. Once you ‘Save’ the request will be processed.
                You will receive an email when the processing is done.
